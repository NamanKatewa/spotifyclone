# To run this project

run command "npm i" in the root of the project directory
then run command "npm start" and voila.

# Security Flaws (A lot of em)

Ignore them cause this project is just for showcase of UI.

# Its not responsive

Because honestly I am not that good with css and also there's not much time for me to make it responsive

# Made only the homepage
